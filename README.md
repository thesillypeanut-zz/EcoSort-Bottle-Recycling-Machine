# EcoSort-Bottle-Recycling-Machine

This code was written for Microchip's PIC18F4620 microcontroller to program a bottle recycling machine which can sort plastic bottles of four types: HDPE bottles with and without caps, and PET bottles with and without caps. The sorting was performed primarily using signals from IR reflection sensors and a laser break beam system. A flowchart outlining the processes executed by the PIC microcontroller can be found in the Final Report pdf file.
